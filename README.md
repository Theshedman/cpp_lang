## Book

A collection of drills and exercises from the book:

- [Programming - Principles and Practice Using C++ 2nd edition](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Principles-Practice-Using-2nd/dp/0321992784) by - [Stroustrup_Bjarne](http://www.stroustrup.com/)

## Structure

This repository is organized to match with the structure of the book. The book [which has 27 chapters and each chapter has drills and exercises] is designed to be read chapter by chapter from the beginning to the end. Each chapter and each section assume understanding of what came before. We try our utmost to update the repository to provide solutions to all the drills and quite a few exercises.

## Drills

You are expected to do all the drills which are very simple exercises devised to develop practical skills. All the drills to each chapter is found under the chapter [`ch1` for chapter one, etc] inside its own folder - `drills`. Some of the exercises are trivial while others are very hard. You are expected to do enough exercises to know which are hard for you. `d1, d2, ...` are the convention used here to number the drills in each chapter.

## Exercises

Exercises for each chapter are found inside the chapter under `exercises`. We use `e1, e2, ...` for numbering of the exercises in each chapter.
